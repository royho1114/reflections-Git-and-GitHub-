How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The access of redo and undo within different versions saves time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: can have proper and logical versions saved
    cons: need to keep in mind of version control

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Every time when we commit, it saves a new version of all files in the
    repository.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives an overview of the changes between two versions;
    git diff gives the actual changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since we could easily check when the errors or bugs happen, don't need to
    worry about making any new changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Maybe try using it for my project
