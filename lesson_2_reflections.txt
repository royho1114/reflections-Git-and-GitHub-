What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git file is made; this will be used to keep track of different versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	I think it's a median of directory and repository. It helps deciding which
	files in the directory should be tracked in repository rather than all files
	in the directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Use the staging area to double check if it's a completed logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	When we are not sure which branch is a better version, we can have several
	branches and compare their performance.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	The diagrams make it very clear to understand the relationship of ascendant
	and decendant of each commit like a tree.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	There is only one branch left and it has changes from both two original
	branches. It shows where the changes are from, and it is clear to see that
	it's from both branches.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	It's very convenient to have automatic merging, but when there is a conflict,
	it can get an unwanted result if it always automatically guesses and does
	merging.
